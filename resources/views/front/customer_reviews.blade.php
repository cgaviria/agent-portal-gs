                            <p><em>I want you to know how much we appreciate our recent cruise and shore excursion package in Europe. The entire experience was wonderful, from the transfers, hotel and especially the shore excursion package. The shore excursion package is the thing that separates you from the others.</em><br />
                                Wendy &#8211; Philadelphia, PA &#8211; <img style="padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="{{asset('images/5star.png')}}" alt="" width="60" height="auto" /></p>
                            <p><em>It was one of the best shore excursions we&#8217;ve ever had. Far superior to the cruise line&#8217;s excursions. The guides we had on this trip were outstanding and the value was very good. The other people we told were jealous.</em><br />
                                Gerry &#8211; Cleveland, OH &#8211; <img src="{{asset('images/5star.png')}}" alt="" width="60" height="auto" /></p>
                            <p><em>We were extremely satisfied with the Shore Excursions we took from you. We loved the Shore Excursions we took at Skagway. Overall, we were treated very professionally and everything went according to schedule. We are very satisfied with the professionalism of your tour guides and we would be willing to take future excursions through your company and will not have any hesitation in recommending the same to other people.</em><br />

                            <p><em>Everything was perfect! I loved that our group was small and under ten people. It made the trip less confusing and more intimate. Our guide was knowledgeable and kind.</em><br />

                            <p><em>This excursion was amazing. We had my 4 year old son up to my 70 year old father in law and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. AMAZING!!!</em><br />

                            <p><em>The whole excursion was great! We would &amp; will recommend it to others. We really enjoyed the guide &#8211; very friendly &amp; knowledgeable.</em><br />

                            <p><em>The instructions we received beforehand were very clear and everything was exactly as they said it would be (no surprises). We only had 6 people in our group. Our guide was very pleasant and explained the ins-and-outs of snorkeling quite well (we were beginners). He was also very safety-conscious and never took his eyes off us in the water. This excursion was a lot of fun!</em><br />

                            <p><em>Looking forward to booking the same tour and guide the next trip to Roatan to see the other parts of the Island. This was my 2nd trip there and I used the ship tour for the 1st. The ship tour wasted a lot of time shopping or waiting the appointed time at each stop, while this was perfectly paced and adjusted to our needs and likes. Our guide was perfect-informative,flexible,professional,and fun to be with! This was the 1st non cruise line tour I decided to book(out of 15 cruises). I will definitely look into your cruise tours for my future cruises.</em><br />

                            <p><em>WOW!! This was the BEST day!! My kids (15, 10) and I were astounded at the number of iguanas!! They enjoyed feeding them, &amp; it only got better. Holding and playing w/monkeys&#8230;. they still talk about it! I would recommend this for people of all ages, but for kids of any age, it is a MUST!!!</em><br />

                            <p><em>Gave us a total sense of the history of Russia in a two-day package. Our guide Anna was the biggest asset &#8212; very knowledgeable and had a fun and informative way about her. All-in-all, this was a fantastic tour that we would recommend highly.</em><br />

                            <p><em>This excursion is not advertised enough! When people ask us what was our favorite thing about visiting Alaska, we answer &#8220;The Bering Sea Crab Fisherman&#8217;s tour&#8221;! The entire crew were knowledgeable, funny, entertaining and great at telling stories. We were lucky to be on the tour on a day that had only a handful of visitors. We felt that we received one on one attention and great photos. Absolutely loved every minute!</em><br />

                            <p><em>I would recommend this trip to anyone looking for a fun family activity for all ages! Our kids are from 9-17 years of age and each had a blast on the zip line adventure. The guides were experienced, careful and good-natured. The beach we visited was sooo beautiful and relaxing, we didn&#8217;t want to leave.</em><br />

                            <p><em>Our guide was so informative. He made the trip. Scenery was fabulous and so glad we did not take the train. This was better, got out for photos and views we could not have from train.</em><br />

                            <p>This was amazing! My boyfriend and I had an absolute blast ziplining! Trust when I say that you won&#8217;t regret booking this excursion!<br />

                            <p><em>This was a great paddle. The tour company was VERY organized and our guide was great. We were able to see sea lions, eagles and even hold a star fish! I would highly recommend this tour.</em><br />

                            <p><em>This excursion was the best activity we participated in. The guides were very cordial and informative. If you are looking for a different adventure, this is the one.</em><br />

                            <p><em>The guide was very experienced and was masterful in managing all the people in our group and the dolphins at the same time. We hugged, kissed and shook hands with them. Wonderful time! </em><br />

                            <p><em>This half day tour of Cavtat and Dubrovnik was for a group of 4 couples and was extremely enjoyable. Great pictures from a point which gave great views of Dubrovnik. The guide was very accommodating and met the entire group&#8217;s needs. I would certainly recommend this tour to anyone going to this area of Croatia.</em><br />

                            <p><em>We saw 8 to 10 humpback whales bubble netting and then 2 orcas swam right past our small boat. It was breathtaking.</em><br />

                            <p><em>What a great time! Our guide, Henry was very entertaining and informative! Plus a great driver as we were on roads that could be quite harrowing and scary, yet exciting. The scenery and sights were spectacular! We loved it! Anytime we wanted to get a picture, Henry accommodated us and made sure we got great shots of the many waterfalls and fabulous scenic views! I can&#8217;t say enough good things about this tour!</em><br />
